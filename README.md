#Marshals roster

I made this to monitor examination marshals (they make sure those taking the exam don't have to worry about getting lost). The exams were so frequent that it got tricky to monitor it all in an Excel spreadsheet so I put this together.

It's pretty basic stuff but made the work more efficient and way less stressful, so I consider it a definite thumbs up emoji.

More functionality could be added to the project, which could make it better, especially a 'tentative' status for those who have been rostered on but have not confirmed attendance for the day. A bulk mail-out email for rostered marshals informing them of their shift would make life very easy.
