#Marshals roster

A basic rostering system to keep track of who has marshalled at what exam, who is rostered on to the next exam and how many exams each marshal has done. Very basic functionality at the moment but a big improvement on the manual system used in Excel and Word.

* consider sending a form 'exam marshalling invitation' email through the click of a button. Pre-rostering would be ideal
* possibly a 'marshals required?' option for exams, to include other meetings that don't need marshals (will eliminate the 'need more marshals' label for exams with marshals < 5)
* make it look good for little screens
* add icons to navbar

* Fill users in seeds
